# HOUSE VINYL IRELAND - README
 
## PURPOSE OF THIS SITE:
House Vinyl Ireland is an online e-commerce Record store. The site specifically sells Vinyl Records in the House music Genre, released through various different labels.
 
The live site can viewed here - https://house-vinyl-ireland.herokuapp.com/
 
## IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
When handling payments, this site makes use of the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb) payment system. When you are testing the payment function of this site; the payment section will ask you to enter card details: Please only enter 4242 until you reach the end. This is the card number that will be recognised by Stripe when a user just wants to test the payment functionality.
 
If you wish to register or receive a confirmation email, you need to enter a real email address or generate a test email through an email generator site when registering or purchasing items.
 
<br>
 
## SUPERUSER SITE ADMIN FUNCTION:
This site uses Django's Admin functionality for content moderation control. The site has a Superuser with their own login credentials.
 
The Admin panel can be accessed simply from the home page. You can navigate to it by clicking in the URL bar, hit / (forward slash) on keyboard and type admin. Like so: **/admin** and hit **enter**
 
**NOTE:**
- During the development of this project, I posted several test review posts and added Test Records. This was done to test the functionality of the **Create Review**, **Edit Review** and **Delete Review** functions. And to test that Records were successfully added, edited and deleted.
- You will also find some comments visible in the review detail, this was also done to test comment functionality.
- **(All of the review content is simply just placeholder text used to test the functionality of content display for site)**
- Site Admin can do all of the above from the admin panel.

# SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) and Marketing
## SEO
Keywords and phrases entered as metadata in the head of the HTML document and throughout the main content of the site helps search engines find relevant, searchable content.

Here is the link to my Facebook Business Page - [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100088359983969&sk=about) and shown below in the screenshot 
![Facebook Page](docs/readme/facebook-page.png) 

I created a Site Map generator for my site using [xml-sitemaps.com](www.xml-sitemaps.com). This enables search engines to find searchable content easily on the site and increase the site's standings in web searches. To make the site GDPR compliant, a robots.txt file was created to restrict access for search engines to parts of the site that contain customer information.

### Marketing
In the footer of every page, site visitors can find a link to sign up to the House Vinyl Ireland newsletter.
![newsletter](readme_images/newsletter.png)
By simply adding their email address to our mailing list via the linked form, visitors agree to the terms and conditions set out in our [privacy policy](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/live.php?token=uRgiA5wGZgVmzSSFHNY8awreHsX1K50b), generated by [Privacy Policy Generator](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/).
A newsletter is a great way to share information about upcoming products and events, and site visitors don't need to login to the site to sign up for the newsletter.

Also in the footer, site visitors can find external links to the related [Facebook Business page](https://www.facebook.com/business/pages) and [Etsy page](https://www.etsy.com/uk/?ref=lgo), where can view information about previous, and future, events and products.

## E-Commerce Business Model
This site is a B2C (business to customer) e-commerce website built for a small independant retailer to sell her handmade products online.

By utilising SEO and marketing techniques, and advertising her USP (unique selling point) of handmade personalised gifts, the site owner aims to increase her client base and expand her business.

As the products are handmade to order, there are no stock levels to control. However, there is a purchase list feature available to the site owner to work from and to manage orders. A notification email is sent to the customer on purchase with a summary of their order and there's scope for further site enhancements in the [Future Features](#future-features) section.

For this site the database will need to store product details such as, name, description, images, sizing, price, available customisations/personalisations. It will need to store customer information such as, name, address, email address, phone number, and will also need to include order details, such as product quantity, sizing, costs etc.  

Customers will pay a one time payment for their order which incorporates product price and delivery costs.

## Agile Planning
<hr>
This project was developed using agile methodologies by delivering apps and features within different epics and sprints, focusing on the most important 'must have' features and some 'could have' or 'should have' features. This approach ensured that all core requirements were completed first to give the project its intended functionlaty with some features that can be added in the future.

The Kanban board was created using github projects and can be located [here](https://github.com/users/David-Maura-Rodgers/projects/2) and can be viewed to see more information on the project cards.

# BUGS & FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS/FEATURES
 
### **Bugs & Known Issues**
- In the commit history there may appear to be some issues with my env.py file. I may have committed too early without having done this properly.
- Again, with the env.py file, my database on Heroku became corrupted so I had to generate new a new Postgres database key variable
- I was trying to implement the Edit and Delete Review function to be accessible from the nav bar, but could not get it to work as hoped. Instead, these feature are accessible from review_detail.html which is accessed via clicking on the the Review Title on view list on the Home page or Your Reviews page
- No lang attribute for html class. This has now been added with "en" value
- Some of the hr lines appear slightly thicker than other in places
- Button inside anchor tags that needed to be changed to forms to be compliant
- Submit Changes button won't go back to Your Reviews page, instead goes back to Home page
- User has to be told to use br html tags to create paragraphs in create a review and edit review forms
 
<br>
 
### **Future features and enhancements**
- Users can see a preview of their post before hitting the Submit button
- User will be able to submit their own photos instead of the one which appears as default
- User can use a search function which searches for strings (for game names, as example)
- User can search for all reviews that are reviewed on a particular console (controlled by the drop down menu choices)
- I wanted to implement the summernote panel on the front end, however, I tried several times to make the note panel responsive to screen width changes. Unfortunately, I had no more time to get this fixed and had to abandon the idea.
- Contact Us page could be added for site user to contact the Site Admin
