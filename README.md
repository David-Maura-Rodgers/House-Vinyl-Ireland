# HOUSE VINYL IRELAND - README
 
## PURPOSE OF THIS SITE:
House Vinyl Ireland is an online e-commerce Record store. The site specifically sells Vinyl Records in the House music Genre, released through various different labels.
 
The live site can viewed here - https://house-vinyl-ireland.herokuapp.com/
 
## IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
When handling payments, this site makes use of the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb) payment system. When you are testing the payment function of this site; the payment section will ask you to enter card details: Please only enter 4242 until you reach the end. This is the card number that will be recognised by Stripe when a user just wants to test the payment functionality.
 
If you wish to register or receive a confirmation email, you need to enter a real email address or generate a test email through an email generator site when registering or purchasing items.
 
<br>
 
## SUPERUSER SITE ADMIN FUNCTION:
This site uses Django's Admin functionality for content moderation control. The site has a Superuser with their own login credentials.
 
The Admin panel can be accessed simply from the home page. You can navigate to it by clicking in the URL bar, hit / (forward slash) on keyboard and type admin. Like so: **/admin** and hit **enter**
 
**NOTE:**
- During the development of this project, I posted several test review posts and added Test Records. This was done to test the functionality of the **Create Review**, **Edit Review** and **Delete Review** functions. And to test that Records were successfully added, edited and deleted.
- You will also find some comments visible in the review detail, this was also done to test comment functionality.
- **(All of the review content is simply just placeholder text used to test the functionality of content display for site)**
- Site Admin can do all of the above from the admin panel.

# SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) and Marketing
## SEO
Keywords and phrases entered as metadata in the head of the HTML document and throughout the main content of the site helps search engines find relevant, searchable content.

Here is the link to my Facebook Business Page - [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100088359983969&sk=about) and shown below in the screenshot 
![Facebook Page](docs/readme/facebook-page.png) 

A Site Map was created by for this site by using [xml-sitemaps.com](www.xml-sitemaps.com). This enables search engines to find searchable content easily on the site. To ensure the site is GDPR compliant, I created a robots.txt file to restrict access for search engines to parts of the site that contain user information.

### Marketing
In the footer of every page, site visitors can find a link to sign up to the House Vinyl Ireland newsletter.
![newsletter](readme_images/newsletter.png)
Site Users can submit their email address on the form prvided on the newsletter page.
The privacy policy was generated by the  [privacy policy](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/live.php?token=uRgiA5wGZgVmzSSFHNY8awreHsX1K50b), generated by [Privacy Policy Generator](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/).
A newsletter is a great way to share information about upcoming products and events, and site visitors don't need to login to the site to sign up for the newsletter.

## E-Commerce Business Model
House Vinyl Ireland B2C (business to consumer) is an e-commerce website built for the purpose of selling Vinyl records from the House music genre across various different record labels. The initial part of the business plan is to sell within Ireland and Northern Ireland with a view to ship orders abroad if the site gets big enough.
 
The aim of this site and the business to become the most reliable and up to date online retailer for house vinyl records in Ireland. The site holds records from 6 different labels, but in time will grow to have more records released under more labels. If the reputation of the site grows, it would also be a nice idea to be linked to house music events in Ireland and be able to do some promotion for them
 
The site will user will have their payments handled by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb). I feel that using such a reputable service will enhance the trust and confidence site visitors will have when purchasing products from this site. Users will also have the ability to register as user of the site and be able to see a history of all the purchases they have made.
 
Another part of the business plan is to create a community among the users of the site. There is a section of the site where they can leave reviews on the records they have purchased. These reviews will be screened by the site admin and posted and be visible to all visitors of the site. A nice future implementation will allow only registered users to leave comments on these reviews.
 
Registered users will also have the option to sign up for a newsletter for the site. The info on these emails will largely be concerned with notifying registered users about new records that have arrived or new deals that are being offered.

## Agile Planning
<hr>
This project was developed using agile methodologies by delivering apps and features within different epics and sprints, focusing on the most important 'must have' features and some 'could have' or 'should have' features. This approach ensured that all core requirements were completed first to give the project its intended functionality with some features that can be added in the future.

The Kanban board was created using github projects and can be located [here](https://github.com/users/David-Maura-Rodgers/projects/2) and can be viewed to see more information on the project cards.

# Testing

Test cases and results can be found in the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file. This was moved due to the size of the file.

## Ligthouse Testing
Please see screen shot below for results of lighthouse testing on the site:
![Lighthouse](docs/readme/lighthouse.png)


## HTML
 
All pages were run through the [w3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
 
**NOTES:**
- I have an error as follows on my basket html page. I have looked through my code several times, but have been unable to correct the problem without disabling the remove function completely:
![Error Basket HTML](docs/readme/error-basket.png)

- I have another error as shown below, however, after much searching it didn't seem to make any sense that I was getting this error on the posted review page. In the interests of time I had to leave it behind.
![Error Posted Review](docs/readme/error-posted-review.png)

- I had the below error on the store/management add product page, which I could not find and rectify:
![Error Add Record](docs/readme/error-add-record.png)

- ***I did receive some duplicate tag warnings for search bar ID, however when these were removed the broke the intended functionality, so I had to leave these tags as they were***
 
<br>
 
## CSS
All css pages were run through the [w3 CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). No errors were found.
 
<br>
 
## PYTHON
 
All pages were run through the official [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) validator to ensure all code was compliant.
 
**NOTE:**
- I had to add # noqa to lines 85 and 86 in the ***webhook_handler.py file in the checkout app*** as I could not find a way to shorten them. 
- I had to add # noqa to lines 21, 22 and 23 in the ***forms.py file in the contact app*** as I could not find a way to shorten them. 
- I had to add # noqa to line 10 in the ***widgets.py file in the products app*** as I could not find a way to shorten them. 
 
<br>
 
## JAVASCRIPT
JavaScript code was run through [JSHINT](https://jshint.com) javascript validator. No errors were found.
 
<br>
 
## Responsiveness
The html elements of this page have largely been constructed using Bootstrap.
- I have used the Inspect option to go through the responsiveness of all pages:
 
![Responsiveness](docs/readme/responsiveness.png)
 
- Site should be responsive and functional on all devices from 280px up
- Hamburger menu appears for mobile devices
 
<br>

## Database-Design

The database was designed to allow CRUD functionality to be available to registered users, when signed in. The database is hosted by **Elephant SQL**.

This is a relational database that links primary and foreign keys together to provide the intended functionality for this site. ***At the time of writing I could not find a DB tool that supports Elephant SQL to create and ERD diagram.*** I have instead provide the screen shot below of my database details as shown on ElephantSQL.

![Elephant SQL](docs/readme/elephantsql.png)

## Security

Views were secured by using the django class based view mixin, UserPassesTextMixin. Login Required decorators were also used. A test function was created to use the mixin and checks were ran to ensure that the user who is trying to access the page is authorized. Any staff restricted functionality, user edit/delete functionality listed in the features was secured using this method.

Environment variables were stored in my Heroku project for security purposes to ensure no secret keys or sensitive information was added the the repository. In production, these variables were added to the heroku config vars within the project.
 
# BUGS & FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS/FEATURES
 
### **Bugs & Known Issues**
- User default delivery information is saved as intented, however, it does not pull through for future purchases that the user wishes to make. This means that users have to enter their info every time they want to make a purchase. This does not affect the site's functionality, but it is an inconvenience for user experience.
- Edit and Delete buttons for Super User are not avialable on medium and smaller resolutions as they created to much of an issue in terms of pushing other elements out and making the appearance look worse overall for the product details page
- Social Media Links may not be completely centre aligned on smaller resolutions, but they still work as intended
- Minus and Plus signs for quantity inputs - not evenly spaced in some resolutions: I tried many different media queries to resolve this. Again, these functions still work as intended.

<br>
 
### **Future features and enhancements**
- Users can edit or delete their reviews as well as post and view them
- Users can leave comments on other users record reviews
- Have an events page that can promote house music events to site visitors
- User could submit a blog post about their favourite labels or records or events they have attended
- Display a stock quantity to site users and have this feature implemented on my product model
- User can search for all reviews that are reviewed on a particular record or label
- I wanted to implement a blinking bored to make the shopping basket icon look more attractive, I did have this enabled initially,
but i removed it as it didn't work as I had intended
