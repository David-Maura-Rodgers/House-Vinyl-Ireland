        "description": "Release Date: 27th September 2022 In anticipation of Kerri Chandler’s forthcoming album Spaces and Places, his first in 14 years, that sees the New Jersey legend celebrating club and soundsystem culture by recording, writing and performing a track in twenty-two of the worlds most distinguished nightclubs, Kaoz Theory drop the fourth in a series of vinyl album samplers. Back with another beautiful gatefold, double 12 inch package for this fourth sampler in the series, that sees Kerri place himself slap bang in the middle of five more of the best clubs the world has to offer. Setting up a makeshift studio workspace in the dancefloor holy grails that are Ministry of Sound, Rex, Razzmatazz, De Marktkantine and Watergate, Kerri soaks up the energy, vibe and atmosphere that each distinct club has within its walls, to translate it into a track in a way that only he knows how. Trademark precision, packed with soul and delivered with a weighty bottom end, this is Kerri Chandler of the highest order",
